# Credit-Risk-Modelling

## Project Background

Credit risk assessment is one of the most critical functions in lending institutions. Financial organizations must decide who to lend to, under what conditions, and at what risk, while minimizing defaults and maximizing portfolio profitability. In this project, historical loan application data is used to predict the likelihood that a customer will default on a loan. The project emphasizes:
* Understanding why customers default
* Identifying key risk drivers
* Designing a scoring framework

The core objectives of this project include to:
* Predict Default Probability
*Understand Risk Drivers
*Create a Scoring Framework
*Evaluate Model Quality Using ROC-AUC and KS statistics.
